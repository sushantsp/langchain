### Learning Plan for OOP in Python

1. **Basics of Classes and Objects**:
   - Define simple classes with attributes and methods.
   - Practice creating instances and calling methods.

2. **Encapsulation**:
   - Learn about private and public attributes.
   - Implement getter and setter methods.
   - Exercise: Create a class with encapsulated attributes.

3. **Inheritance**:
   - Understand how to create subclasses from a parent class.
   - Explore the use of `super()` to call parent class methods.
   - Exercise: Create subclasses with additional methods or overridden methods.

4. **Polymorphism**:
   - Learn how different classes can implement the same interface.
   - Practice method overriding.
   - Exercise: Implement polymorphism in a simple program.

5. **Advanced Topics** (optional based on interest and time):
   - Abstract classes and methods.
   - Interfaces and their implementation in Python.
   - Special methods (e.g., `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`).

6. **Project-Based Learning**:
   - Apply all concepts learned in a small project, such as a library management system or a simple game.
   - Focus on structuring the project using OOP principles.

### Our Current Position

We have just completed the basics of classes and objects. Next, we'll move on to **Encapsulation**. We'll cover the theory briefly and then practice with an exercise.
